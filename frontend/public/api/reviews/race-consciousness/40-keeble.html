  Unflinching, powerful, personal -- Race Consciousness reveals Carol Leutner's
  journey through the rapids and hidden depths of power, race and love. It is
  sometimes bitter-sweet, sometimes tragic, sometimes euphoric, but overall, it
  outraged her and made her fight the oppressors on behalf of herself, her
  family, and the Navajo nation. Go with her in this book. It could change you,
  too.
