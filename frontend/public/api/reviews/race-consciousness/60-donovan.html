  Many books have been written about racial issues, but few adopt the reasoned
  and balanced juxtaposition between political and personal experience as Carol
  E. Leutner in <em>Race Consciousness: A Personal and Political Journey</em>.
  Leutner's memoir of personal empowerment and relationship-building creates a
  dialogue that moves between experience, ideals, and difficult choices made in
  navigating a biased system.
