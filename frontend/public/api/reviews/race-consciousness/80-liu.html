<div class='review'>
  Ms. Carol Leutner is a remarkable woman. Her book reveals a challenging life approached with an optimistic and
  unyielding spirit. Her courage to break through racial barriers in her own life and American society deserves the
  respect of all. I was impressed and touched by her struggles and success. Carol is also an “international person.” Her
  enthusiasm and interest in exploring and embracing different cultures has given her an enriching and enviable personal
  experience. She is also a role model for women who juggle family and career. Her journey proves that women’s
  determination, intelligence, and perseverance can finally prevail and succeed in the still male-dominated society.
