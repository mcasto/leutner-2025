  A young bride questions her family learning, her university learning, and her
  marriage to an Episcopal priest. This is a well-written, thought-provoking
  insight of what it was like to be female, young and idealistic and relatively
  powerless in the 60s. From her early work on a Navajo Reservation in Arizona
  to agencies of the United Nations, Carol E. Leutner chronicles how
  institutional arrangements can impede economic development for marginalized
  and resource-poor communities, this is also the poignant sharing of what itâ€™s
  like to be a woman juggling family and career, not willing to sacrifice one
  for the other.
