<div class="review">
  This memoir chronicles the life of a courageous woman whose tenacity and
  determination gave her a front row seat to many of the most pivotal social and
  political movements of her time. Carol carved out an impressive career that
  ranged from the Navajo Nation to the United Nations. The tone is matter-of-fact and
  unapologetic, yet reveals moments of great
  uncertainty, loss and resilience that add up to a remarkable life story.Â 
  Carol summarizes her trans-continental journey with an invitation for America
  to embark on a New Global Conversation about race, humanity and the basic
  quality of life we all strive for.
