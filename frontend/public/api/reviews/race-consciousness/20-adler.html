  Carol Leutner’s memoir transcends the limitations of the genre. Her decades of
  commitment to racial and economic justice, personal battles on behalf of her
  family, and professional experience as a woman in often hostile environments
  span the globe. From rural outposts to national and international centers of
  power, she persevered and maintained a belief in the higher good. She has
  touched the lives of so many that this is more than an inspiring individual
  story. If it weren’t a true-life adventure, it would read like a thrilling
  soap opera.
