    I read your Paradigm Shift and enjoyedÂ it -- and agree with it. My dad was an evolutionary biologist who had a lifetime mission to refute Darwinian orthodoxy. His point was that life isn't random and accidental, but guided and nourished by the universe, and that evolution is even self-directed by many species. It's a good book with a good proposal.
