    Carol E. Leutner's 21st Century Paradigm Shift offers a powerful twist on the idea "Everything is a brand," linking discussions of Newtonian and quantum physics with the observation that capitalism's paradigm is not set in stone, but can be shifted to redirect human nature. The cross-disciplinary connections presented in Leutner's book are not just thought-provoking, but essential reading, because we are all caught in a paradigm. A scholarly yet accessible read.
