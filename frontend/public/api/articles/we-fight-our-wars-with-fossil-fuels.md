In late January of this year, three U.S. service persons died following an attack on a U.S. military base in Jordan close to the Syrian border. Within hours the Pentagon announced their intent to respond to both the itinerant group ostensibly responsible for the attack and to installations in Iran and Syria that support them.

The first sortie of fighter jets consisted of F-15s and F-16s, followed by the more powerful B-1 which carried a heavier payload and flew non-stop from the U.S. to its target(s) and back. Good weather made the latter flight possible. This military response was justified in the interest of national security and regional containment.

It is estimated that at peak thrust the B-15 ignites 52 gallons of fuel per minute or 86 barrels per hour. The B-52 (precursor to the B-1) burns at least double that amount. A 2019 Brown University study entitled “Pentagon Fuel Use, Climate Change, and the Cost of War” found that the U.S. Department of Defense is the world’s single largest consumer of petroleum products and consumes eighty percent of all U.S. government energy consumption.

As the world’s largest institutional user of petroleum, it follows then that DOD is also the world’s largest single institutional emitter of greenhouse gases.

By 2019 the U.S. Department of Defense had not yet admitted its role in contributing to this risk. The policy was to deal with the negative effects or symptoms. In 2021, however, the Pentagon released an action plan that called for incorporating climate factors and considerations into decision-making processes and lowering emissions through contractor and supplier disclosures. Actions designed to reduce emissions or decrease dependency on oil were not discussed.

So here we have a disconnect.

Scientists estimate that in at least one of the next five years Earth will surpass the 1.5-degree tipping point, threatening irreversible changes to critical life-support systems.

**The climate emergency is a bigger threat than any war.**

The U.S. response in the Middle East and elsewhere will neither ensure national security or prevent wider conflict. Wars fought with fossil fuels will be trumped by Mother Nature and a warming planet, leading to conflicts for survival that encompass entire geographical regions regardless of national borders.

One can only imagine how the Israeli-Hamas war will be exacerbated by this summer’s grilling heat. Will this conflation of human and natural factors help raise our consciousness about the connection between war’s threat to climate stability and our own?

This malady of an inability to connect the dots or “unconsciousness” is not limited to U.S. soil. As far back as 1997, when the U.S. demanded military exemptions to the Kyoto Protocol, global militaries have remained exempt from reporting emissions up to and including the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Military’s role in the climate emergency was not even discussed until a COP event in 2022, in spite of the fact that **global militaries are the fourth largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.**

Nation states argue that disclosing such data represents a potential treat to national security. China, for example has not specifically pledged to curb emissions, focusing primarily on the energy sector; the Russian military does not have a climate plan in place. India sees it as a security threat but has taken no action since 2015.

While it may be difficult to determine how much the general public knows about the issue of war, emissions and climate or how they feel about the issue politically or emotionally, it is not hard to estimate. Military budgets and infrastructure are increasing globally.

Thus, the nexus of war and climate is not yet an issue of public debate or public policy.

While traditional alternatives to war, such as diplomacy and sanctions, are enacted on legal, economic or moral grounds, rationales related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions’ impact on climate change is hard to come by. Since pleas from scientists and activists reach limited audiences, i.e., preaching to the choir, it is time to change the narrative. And the goal of any new narrative needs is to raise consciousness about this relationship between war and the climate emergency.

Two cognitive pillars buttress this new narrative and function to simultaneously raise awareness of the war-climate connection and deepen our thought process about how to respond.

Last month, Johan Rockstrom won what is known as the environmental Nobel Prize for his work identifying nine life-support systems that have kept the plant stable since the end of the Ice Age.

**By September last year, an analytical assessment determined that six of the nine systems’ boundaries had been crossed.**

Massive numbers of people need to wake up to the fact that when natural systems fail, economic systems fail. Civilization is a stake; everything is at risk.

Second, the logical response to the climate emergency is cooperation, not conflict.

When Spanish immigrants settled in the mountains of northern New Mexico over 400 years ago, modern irrigation systems didn’t exist. Their gravity-flow systems, designed after Moorish techniques brought from Spain along with improvements learned from their Indigenous neighbors, was based on cooperation. These systems are in use today. Survival depended on them.

For many who are conscious of the risk, there is a feeling of being stuck. How can a new narrative of urgency and cooperation emerge when political leaders remain wedded to myths of national superiority and resource accumulation?

It will fall to the youth whose level of consciousness about the climate emergency has freed them from the shackles of post-Cold War paradigms and priorities. They will articulate the nexus between war, climate and humanity’s future and issue the clarion call.
