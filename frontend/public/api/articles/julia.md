This article honors my friend, Julia Rux. Julia was one of those persons that expats like me, living in the now international city of Cuenca, are privileged to know. I have a wonderful life here and wonderful friends. Julia exemplified those human qualities that I identify with and appreciate in others: intellectual curiosity, youthfulness and the love of community.

My friendship with Julia was short — a little over a year. I met her through her friend Patricia who bought my memoir, _Race Consciousness, A Personal and Political Journey._ She shared the book with Julia. When the three of us expats met, we opened up about all of the issues in the book, politics of race and gender, the Indigenous people of the Americas, and so many travels — Italy and South America mainly. After that the friendship took off in all three areas I remember and admire Julia for.

**Julia was Curious**

Julia held a Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology and a Masters in Cultural Anthropology. When I commented that this was a strange combination, she replied, "No, that's how we understand why cultures act like they do and get to know them better," which made sense to me. Julia and Patricia set about to promote my memoir, including long discussions with friends and a talk at one of Julia's Ladies Luncheons, which always featured a "new" restaurant. Julia and another friend had organized these over years, bringing a new speaker or presentation to expats on life in Cuenca. You see, it was not about her degrees, but rather her intellectual curiosity — ever expanding her circle of interests and companions to share it with.

This aspect of Julia culminated with an invitation to discuss my memoir with her book club, now known as Julia's Book Club. Julia belonged to many other book clubs as well, both in English and Spanish. On 6 January at La Yunta restaurant, a "not-only-ladies" gathering dug for over two hours into the issues of race, gender, motherhood, work-life struggles, and risk. Julia wanted to know more about corn and its significance to my Navajo friends who had offered it. This was a special moment, hearing Julia's query. She wanted to dig deeper.

**Julia was Youthful**

The name Julia is derived from Latin and refers to youthfulness. Being youthful is not about age or appearance, but rather the aura that one possesses and exudes. I will be young if my spirit says "I am alive today to enjoy and engage in every moment that life presents, while conscious of the gift and privilege of another day." Julia's spirit communicated this message.

I remember the day we met for lunch at Yaku Bistro to discuss my presentation at the book club meeting. She was dressed to the nines — a pillar of contrasting black and white. But I remember most the long, beaded black earrings that swayed as she spoke. "You look fantastic!" I said, thinking I should have made more of an effort to dress.

"Thank you, after this I have another meeting which will end in a late dinner," she replied. She was able to pack more in a day than I could. Youthfulness shows through an aura of energy and anticipation.

**Julia Loved Community**

Always a world traveler, Julia came to Ecuador on a Fulbright program to teach at the University of Cuenca. She also lived with a Cuenca family which began her lifelong appreciation for the Ecuadorian people and her love of community. Julia spoke perfect Spanish and her apartment was filled with terra cotta and textiles sculpted and woven by village artisans. Her book club selections focused on strong women from various cultures and their battles for recognition and success in leadership. Julia herself supported many projects helping women throughout Amazonia and the Sierra. While she understood the spiritual and communal roots of Ecuadorian culture, and particularly its Indigenous cultures, this appreciation of her beloved, adopted country was not an intellectual one. It was an experiential one — the warmth between Julia and her compatriots was reciprocal. To Julia, reciprocal also meant supportive.

Over Christmas, I remember Julia working feverishly to round up participants in her planned week-long journey by bus to the Choco Andino. This would not be her first organized jaunt to expose fellow expats to the fascinating area north of Quito that straddles both Sierra and Oriente. "Oh, you must join us!" she said, "We will be staying in haciendas where all proceeds go directly to local families and the community. The last time we went, we learned about a hacienda dating from the colonial period where they released their indentured workers only forty years ago. Can you imagine?" she exclaimed.

That was Julia. she wanted you to know and appreciate what she knew and understood, wanting to give you context and thereby enlarge your thinking about others and their situations. She wanted to share her love of the Ecuadorian people.

Julia was a pillar in the community. Being in her presence was not only intellectually stimulating but also warm. She made her friends feel bonded to a higher and growing life force — she inspired. Julia leaves a legacy in Cuenca that is powerful and unique.

Julia died on February 26, 2025. She was a true intellect, a truth-seeker, a loving human being, and guardian of all that is just and fair in this world. She will be missed. I will miss her.
