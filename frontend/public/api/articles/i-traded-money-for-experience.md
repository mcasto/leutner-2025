**I TRADED MONEY FOR EXPERIENCE…**

**_and got better at risk analysis_**

by Carol E. Leutner

When most people think about risk analysis, they think first about money — specifically return on investment (ROI) and portfolio diversification. I know about these strategies because I have graduate degrees in business and law and spent a career in economic development financing for low-income and resource-poor communities, both nationally and internationally. As an economic system, capitalism’s chief objective is to grow and protect money. Risk analysis is critical to that goal.

Perhaps I decided subconsciously to trade being wealthy for the richness of life experiences when I realized at an early age that I was not positioned to ever become really rich. I didn’t want to compete in that arena. Coming of age in the Sixties, I wanted to make social change to address poverty and racism.

By 1965, I had my undergraduate degree and was married to an Episcopal priest. We could work, earn comfortable salaries and be active on social issues. There was no need for me to engage in risk analysis or make a choice between money versus experience.

**My First Dive into Risk Analysis**

Three years later those circumstances changed. When my husband was assigned to a 100-year-old Episcopal mission on the Navajo reservation, I found a high-level job in tribal government. Within months I was given more responsibility, raising federal funds and managing new programs. I began to realize how valuable my communication and coordination skills were in multi-jurisdictional and multi-cultural settings. The marriage suffered. My husband’s family had generational wealth. By 1971 I had to make a decision. My analysis went something like this.

The professional skills and achievements gleaned on the reservation were marketable and represented a return on investment for my hard work. I would not need to depend on my husband or his family’s money. I could be free to do the work I loved. Although I could have mitigated the risk and continued in my current job, future employment opportunities would be filled by returning, educated Navajos.

The simultaneous decision to divorce and resign in 1971 was based on risk analysis. I was the capital — body, mind, spirit and soul — an asset 100% equity-owned by me. I became aware that my personal and professional strength and capabilities secured the investment.

T**he Second Time I Had to Make a Choice**

Several years later I was living like a White-woman suburbanite in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the only exception being that this time my husband was African American. He was a politically-active human relations and communications consultant with state contracts. We bought a house and were blessed with two daughters. When my research job in Santa Fe led to a professional dead end, I started to work on a graduate business degree and later entered law school full-time.

With only one income, we downsized and sold the house for double its purchase price, confirming that real estate represents a low-risk investment. Now we could both earn advanced degrees and expand our career options. Diversifying one’s portfolio seemed like a better hedge against risk than owning property. After graduation and new jobs, we could always buy another house, which we did.

Then life circumstances changed. Disagreement over finances reached an impasse; we divorced and my second husband relocated to Washington D.C. to find work. I was alone with the children in the house when our oldest daughter’s degenerative neurological disease was diagnosed. Now I had to make a choice. Should I take a risk and move?

Resources for my daughter’s illness were in the nation’s capital along with the children’s father and his large family. My aging parents in Baltimore needed help. I would have to sell the house, close my law practice and look for new work — at age forty. So, I analyzed the risk, not based on the projected loss of capital, but rather the projected gains for my largest investment — me.

Since those days on the Navajo reservation, I knew that my economic development and public policy credentials were strong. I had diversified my portfolio with two disciplines at the heart of how government works — finance and law. I would combine these skills to chart a new career path in Washington. Now, too, I trusted my tactical and strategic decision-making skills, both as a lawyer and mother. Not only had I won controversial race and gender discrimination cases, I’d been on the political frontlines with my ex-husband in a racist state. I was ready to take the leap.

**The Final and Highest Risk**

My move to the East Coast was filled with surprises. A month after landing at my parents’ house, the engine on my car burnt out. Sale of the New Mexico house netted no profit and seven years of private law practice did not make me competitive in the D.C. legal market. I ended up working part-time to rebuild a non-profit organization on Capitol Hill. Once the girls and I were settled there, I focused on their health and education. It was hard. D.C. has always been expensive and my daughter’s mobility issues made my role as mother even more challenging. Massive debt from medical bills, a divorce and the move forced me into bankruptcy.

I juggled every minute and every end-of-month. There was no one to rely on but me. That meant digging deep to locate my core of inner strength and hold fast to a vision for the girls’ future. I called into play my knowledge of economics, philosophy and science from my graduate business school studies.

Quantum physics teaches us that what we think is real is just energy — quanta. Humans perceive it as real to function in the physical realm. The quantum reality is multidimensional and influenced by actions of the observer. I learned to use my consciousness to focus on desired outcomes — move the sub-atomic particles with my mind. I identified and leveraged resources where most would have seen none. I wove this perspective into teachings from my Christian faith and the Navajo worldview. This was the greatest benefit of trading money for experience.

After my daughter’s medical condition had stabilized and both girls earned full scholarships to out-of-state schools, I reinvented myself. First, by diversifying my portfolio with a Master’s degree in International Law from Georgetown. Once again, my biggest investment was in me. Next, I integrated my prior work in rural development with my legal training and rewrote my resume. Finally, I located a place where I might sell that experience — at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome and got on the plane.

I was qualified to make the final and most risky move because the analysis was done in relation to me — my greatest asset. My professional skills and education credentials were solid. Although I had only a few thousand dollars, no network, no job, and no plan B, I knew how to fit together what appeared to be disparate resources and connections to make a whole greater than the sum of its parts. **That experience was more valuable than money.**

**Conclusion**

Modern capitalist society convinces us that we need money to reach our goals, fulfill our dreams and survive. These teachings limit our perspective and dampen the possible. I share my story because it represents an alternative way — **an option for coping with capitalism.**

This perspective on what is most valuable laid the foundation for twenty years of rewarding international work. My resources and choices are probably different from yours, but the process of self-affirmation versus balance sheets is the same. Perhaps this strategy can work for you. **Invest in yourself and then analyze the risk.**
