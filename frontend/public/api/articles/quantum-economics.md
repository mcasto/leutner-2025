_Interviewed by Shawn Jr. of Medium_

_To begin, would you mind sharing a little bit about yourself and the topic that you’d like to discuss today?_

Right, so I’m an author. I’m a lawyer. I’m a political activist, although not so much right now. I’m a former international civil servant for the UN. And once my UN work was over, I had time to write a book. So then I became an author.

And that’s a memoir, and it’s called ‘Race Consciousness, A Personal and Political Journey’. I have another book coming, but I’ll discuss that later in the questions.

And I continue to write articles mainly on race, economics, and culture.

_The topic is that I critique capitalism, but from the philosophical mind trap, which we will explore._

_Can you share a little bit about your discovery phase of exploring capitalism from that perspective?_

Okay, so in my early career, I did rural economic development work, primarily for the Navajo tribe, always in resource poor communities, and in Hispanic Pueblos in north central New Mexico. So that’s what got me into the whole issue of economics. And then later, I started to work on an MBA.

I have a joint MBA JD. When I took the econ course, I was not happy with what I learned. I didn’t agree with the fundamental principles that, you know, labor can freely move in the markets or natural self-regulating mechanisms.

So I asked the professor if I could do an independent study to pursue how it came to be. And he said, yes, but you will end up studying the history of economic thought. So that’s what I did.

It took me a year, but I produced a paper. And that paper, which is called Economics and Metaphysics, Framework for the Future, actually won an award at the American Economic Association in 1982. It’s published in The Review of Social Economy, which is an academic journal managed by the Catholic universities in the country, Loyola, Xavier, DePaul.

_How has this impacted your day-to-day activities?_

Well, I think I have to tell you a little bit about what my journey of discovery was regarding capitalism, because when you look at the history of capitalism, what you find is that back in the 1600s, when Newton’s notion of what reality was, and at that time it was called natural philosophy, came onto the scene, people agreed that nature was indeed everything. That everything you saw was real, and that nature operated like a machine. It was mechanical, and it was operating according to natural law.

And that was picked up by economics, you know? Newton’s idea of the organizing principle of gravity, Adam Smith, who really is the founder of all of this, compared that to self-interest as an organizing principle. In the beginning, economics was called the political economy. It wasn’t really a science.

It was only some centuries later that it became a hardcore science. And unfortunately, so many of these philosophical foundations have been lost.

So then, when I discovered that, oh my goodness, this all grows out of a world view based upon science. But we know that by the turn of the century, Einstein and Einstein’s colleagues, like Niels Bohr and Max Planck and Schrodinger and Heidegger, okay, they had upended that view of reality.

So now we know that space and time are relative. And we know that at the quantum level, things don’t necessarily act in a very mechanical way. As a matter of fact, it sort of upended that Newtonian view of reality, which works for things in our physical world.

But at a much deeper level, that is not how reality operates. And so now you have physicists writing about this. You’re talking about energy in terms of quanta and how subatomic particles can’t be put in a specific place.

You can only look at the probability that they will be there. You have multidimensionality in terms of quanta being a one or a zero at the same time. That’s why we get quantum computing. And the idea that the observer influences an experiment, which influences reality.

So then, after I discovered that we could look at a new version of reality through these new scientific discoveries, then the question became, how could that impact economics? That’s a lot of work to do, but the new reality is multidimensional. It’s relational, it’s integrated, it’s not separated. And we, with our consciousness, have a responsibility and a role to play.

For many years, while I was studying and raising a family and busy working, it didn’t have a lot of impact. But it was always in my mind.

OK, so, but many years later, with a diagnosis of my oldest daughter’s incurable neurological disease, things got really difficult. At this point, I was no longer in the Southwest, I was in the nation’s capital, which can be a very challenging experience. I’m originally from Baltimore.

The children’s father, who was African American, was also from Washington, D.C. So that’s the node of operation for me. So then I really began to apply these principles. I began to think that I could move matter with my mind, to tell you the truth.

So those were, you know, those were difficult years. But the things that I wanted to happen, happened. I mean, I’m very disciplined and I’m a hard worker and I’m smart.

But at some point, things were happening that, well, you can call it coincidence or you can call it luck. And a lot of this is in the book. This is a journey.

It’s a personal journey, but it’s also a journey of political awakening because of what I dealt with in terms of the racism, not just with the children’s father. We did Jesse Jackson’s first residential campaign in New Mexico. That’s all in the book, but also the institutional issues, particularly in relation to the Navajo natural resources management.

So, even though it seems like this is all very abstract, it actually had a big, a big, a big impact. And I’ve continued to write about it. I have a few articles that were published that I’d like to redo and maybe republish on Medium. One is called Economics and Consciousness. One is called Only Capital. And now I have a new one that I want to publish it. The one I want to publish with you is called Why Is Capitalism Killing Us? Blame it on the high cost of transactions. It begins talking about some current incidences, but it ultimately goes into this topic of the philosophical mindset.

And then after I did the memoir, I continued to write on this topic. That’s the second book. The second book is called 21st Century Paradigm Shift. What it is and how to survive it. Because this is a paradigm shift. And it’s only 10,000 words, but it’s about this topic. And for the, it’s the paper, but for a general reader and for now. Interesting.

_I’m kind of stepping away from the questions I had because I feel like there’s just so much that you just shared that is really interesting to dig into. I would like to start by understanding, since coming face to face with this topic, and your own work within your family, have you met others who have shared similar views as yourself or even dissimilar? And how do you integrate this new view, this new mindset that you have into the communities that you interact with? Have you been welcomed by others or have you been met with aversion?_

Well, some people who hear me talk about this, think that this is in outer space or over their head.

But what we have is physicists who are talking about this. In fact, today I listened to a YouTube video that I will share with you. It’s an interview with Carlos Roselli, an Italian physicist.

His book on quantum physics is all about this relational idea. And I’ll send that to you. Deepak Chopra is also writing about this on Medium. But he is writing about quantum in terms of the mind, the spirit and the body. You see, he’s a medical doctor and he’s an Eastern philosopher in Eastern religions.

It’s very easy to make all of the connections. There may be some, I know of one institute in London where maybe they’re working on this. But I wouldn’t say people are really working on this from an economic perspective.

But I think it is ripe, you know? It’s a topic that is a little esoteric, but it’s becoming less so. Why? I think we have to have more crisis to get attention.

You know, there is a special on PBS called A Brief History of the Future. There were four of them. You can even stream it, I think. I’ve watched three. I think the next one is next Wednesday. And he’s talking about, and everybody’s talking about this, it’s a pivotal time, all the threads, humanities, you know, even Yuval Noah Harari says that we got 100 years left for humanity.

So everybody is struggling to figure out, what is it? How can we come together? Are we going to keep on killing each other?

_What is capitalism’s role with this type of thinking?_

Ah, well, I think we have to look at capitalism as a historical phenomenon, you know? I mean, it evolved at a time when you had an understanding of reality that said that this is real, you know, that all the physical stuff in the world can be manipulated.

We can manipulate it. There were always markets and people are always involved in economic activity, because it grows out of nature. Of course, what I say is, if nature fails, economy fails because it was their view of nature that could be exploited and manipulated in the interest of the self.

People have to think deeper. Look, people are very shallow, and most people are fearful. But you have to have leaders who think more deeply.

There’s nothing absolute about capitalism. It’s a historical phenomenon reflecting our understanding of nature and reality at the time. It has outlived its usefulness, because we can no longer exploit nature.

It was a limited view of nature. Just like we have to have a new relationship with, at the subatomic or quantum level. And we’re quanta, you know, we’re quanta too, we’re energy fields.

I’m not real. Maybe my consciousness is, but it’s another conversation. That’s for Deepak, right? If that’s the way it is, well, we built it on this version, and it’s not working. We have a new version, let’s build it. So we can use capitalism as an example of how you could use science to restructure.

When I went to Italy to work for the UN, I didn’t speak Italian. But I knew how to learn a foreign language, because I was a German major. But I hadn’t used it for many years.

It’s the same way. We know we can structure something based on our understanding of reality and get an economic system that will serve us. But it can’t be that Newtonian version of reality and that version of economics, because it’s outdated. We have new information, deeper, more profound. And now we have to use it.

_What are some paths that individuals can take to think deeply about our relationship with nature? Secondly, do you think that there is ever a chance for a system to be able to account for this ever-changing understanding of our relationship to each other and the world?_

Yeah, and I write about this is in the second book.

I hope to have that out by the end of the year. I’ve already written it, actually.

I wrote it over a year ago, but I have to go back because things are changing so quickly. Well, first of all, I think it’s a personal journey from the standpoint you have to recognize that maybe your thinking is too limited.

And let’s think more broadly. Let’s think more broadly about who you interact with. Think about how you can get out of your box, whatever that is. Your silo.

Open yourself up to some things that you may not have wanted. I mean, there’s a woman who I quote in the book, in the memoir, talking about how people don’t want to talk about, or can’t talk about race. Just like they can’t talk about climate change. And what she says is, to talk about climate change with somebody who is the polar opposite from you, you must find common ground.

You must start there. The same thing applies to race. You must, with that individual, find a common ground and start there.

See, that is a process of opening the mind. And then you have to realize, oh, if you’re taking in new information, then your level of consciousness about what’s going on around you has to open up.

In the prologue for the new book, the last line is, this is not a time to be fearful or judgmental. It’s a time to be open to change. You can read Deepak for this. You won’t find much on economics, but I think it’s coming.

I’m trying to contribute to it. It took me five years to get that paper published. Why? Because that was the time, in the 80s. I finished that paper in 1978.

I was published in 82 by this group that is interested in social economics. But what was happening in the 80s? Milton Friedman and the Chicago School, neoliberalism, which is only starting to crack now.

It’s only started to crack like in the last, what, even in the last decade. So nobody’s interested in talking about this, what I was writing about. But I think that it’s opening.

And I think people have to individually open up and then things will flow. I think that’s a really clear path for individuals to embody this openness and find that calming ground.

_Are you hopeful that this type of shift in consciousness, towards openness, is something that we, as a society, actually have the opportunity to experience? Or do you feel like, as you mentioned earlier, we need to have this crisis, and we might not make it out of it?_

I’m curious. That’s where we are, 50–50. It’s a choice, right? I mean, there’s an article on Medium saying, what will AI say about us after we’re gone?

We do everything based upon the stories. And these are just stories. But you have to remember, at the end of the Middle Ages, into the Renaissance, Reformation, dawn of the nation-state, blah, blah, blah, people had all the church stories, and then they got new stories.

And so now we have to have new stories. But there’s a big problem because the media is so entrenched in the stories that are dystopian, that people, I don’t think, have any agency. People have to reclaim their agency.

You were the first and only publication that I was interested in. This is how I’m coping. This is how I cope with capitalism.

Our society is dependent on these transactions. Everything revolves around more and more transactions.

Cut up a freaking meal, and you’ve got 10 people wanting a slice of the big transaction. You see, that’s the article. So I’m hopeful in the sense that I don’t think we have a lot of choice, unless we just want to let it go.

Unless we want to just let, you know, three million years since Lucy was discovered, go to waste. There’s a lot going on that tells us maybe we’re not going to let it go. You know, because, I mean, well, this gets into other things, but like, I mean, the Guardian, did this huge study about how it was founded by slave owners in Britain.

They have a series called Capital Cotton and how Manchester and Liverpool were built on cotton from the American South. It’s amazing. All of this history that people want us to put under the carpet. It’s only making people want to get more information. Unless we deal with the gender divide and the racial divide, we ain’t going nowhere.

_But this is part of an understanding of reality at the quantum level, at its deepest level. You see, it’s a thing. Reality is not about things. It’s about connections._

Thank you for taking the time to read this interview. Are you experiencing a daily struggle with the well, or not-so well-known issues found in capitalism? Are you experiencing success among the chaos? This is a chance to share your story. I’d love to discuss all topics, be it positive or negative with yourself.
