**_there is no hiding the truth_**

In early 2022, the nation watched U.S. Federal Appeals Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, skillfully manage the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings which led to approval of her nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. She was steadfast, balanced, principled and proud. She affirmed her dedication to public service and equal justice under the law, and became the first Black woman to sit on the nation’s highest court — after 240 years.

Since 2008, we have watched Michelle Obama define the role of First Lady, while in the White House and beyond. Although she could be informed by the choices of her predecessors, the story of how an African American woman would handle the job had yet to be written. Now we know that the power of Mrs. Obama’s voice and words transcend her physical presence. She speaks to the commonality of our humanness. People listen.

Persons familiar with public institutions and politics have recognized Kamal Harris for years. They have witnessed her transformation into one of America’s leading female lawyers and her groundbreaking accomplishments as a Black woman. When she entered the global arena, she spoke with passion but soon realized that some of her words resonated more positively than the realities around her. Undeterred, she moved forward. Now we are witnessing another historic first at a pivotal point in our history.

What stands out as a fundamental connection among these three Black women is their clarity of thought. Their journey is not defined by ego, competition or status but rather a lifelong dedication to discovering and nurturing an inner strength which they can share and celebrate it with others. Each of them recognizes that their power is deeply anchored in the strength of other Black women, particularly their mothers.

**Jackson, Obama and Harris are the standard bearers for a generation of leaders, not only in communication but in character. For anyone, man or woman, to deny that truth, is to deny their own capacity to achieve excellence.**

Women, especially dark-skinned women, represent one of the most oppressed and discriminated groups worldwide. This is evident in statistics like the high maternal mortality rates in the U.S. They are often the last to achieve influence or wealth, and encounter daunting barriers and challenges along the way. With Jackson, Obama and Harris, that ceiling has now been shattered. If it can be overcome for Black women, it can be overcome for everyone. We should all be empowered to chase our dreams.
