  On my most recent trip to see my family in Washington, D.C., I finally had
  time to visit the National Museum of African American History and Culture.
  Opened in 2016, it is the most visited of all of the Smithsonian’s 19 museums.
  The museum follows classical Greco-Roman design with a base and shaft topped
  by a three-tiered, open-worked metal crown inspired by those used in Yoruban
  art in West Africa.

  My daughter got two highly-sought-after passes for one cold, rainy afternoon.
  She had been many times and told me that if we start on the lowest level (the
  bowels of a slave ship which held bound Africans) that alone would take the
  entire visit. I was disappointed. I’d married into a Black family, had
  acquired great respect for Black history and culture, and wanted to see how
  this 500-year-old legacy of tragedy and triumph was portrayed. No matter, I
  took what I could get.
</p>

<p>
  We started on the top floor with its revolving exposition of contemporary
  paintings, sculpture and textiles as well as artifacts from twentieth-century
  culture and achievements. Following art works dedicated to resistance and
  resilience, we entered a more intimate oval-shaped enclosure dedicated to the
  African diaspora in the Caribbean and Central and South America. Cases
  displayed culinary and musical contributions of Africans in Cuba and Costa
  Rica, for example. Almost every country and economic sector was represented.
  There was even a display of products (with advertisements) used to whiten dark
  skin, a trend that swept the region. Lighter-skinned people generally enjoyed
  greater opportunity and privilege than darker-skinned, regardless of location.
</p>

<div class="text-h6">Two Surprises</div>
<p>
  The display that struck me most, however, and which was literally staring back
  at me, read “Ecuadorian Stories.” I was shocked! I live in Cuenca, Ecuador.
  How could Ecuador have followed me into this unique and sacred space? The
  centerpiece of the display was a small, curved and carved wooden boat seat
  (circa 1945). The etched spider and web design represented Anansi, a trickster
  character from diaspora folktales. Anansi taught life lessons about survival
  and resistance. The explanatory text continued: “Through these stories,
  enslaved and subjected Blacks imagined a different world order, where they
  could control their own fates.” The grandmother of the donor, Juan Garcia
  Salazar, was a Black woman who used this seat as she traveled the rivers of
  Ecuador’s coastal Esmeraldas Province and at home when she shared these tales
  with her grandson.

<p>
  While I was trying to process this amazing connection to where I live, I had
  another surprise. In 2005, Juan Garcia carried his gift into the office of
  this new museum’s first director — Lonnie Bunch III. Mr. Bunch is now
  secretary of the Smithsonian. Once again, the explanatory text provided
  powerful insight and information. “Salazar’s donation confirms our shared
  heritage as African-descended people. The seat became the first item in this
  museum’s collection.” I was hooked. I had to know more. How had the decision
  to move the seat from Ecuador to the United States been made? What was the
  backstory to this incredible donation? Mr. Salazar’s gift to the museum began
  to feel like a gift to me.
</p>
<p>
  Back in Cuenca, I started my research at the Museo Pumapungo, Ecuador’s only
  research-level ethnographic museum. Since the director of ethnography was on
  vacation, I headed to the library. This is a large, second-floor space with a
  wall of glass that overlooks Pumapungo’s Inca ruins. None of the staff I
  talked to knew about the gift, but they all knew Juan Garcia. He was a writer
  and intellectual from Esmeraldas, whose mother was Black and father, Spanish.
  A thin biography that the staff recommended told me that Salazar dedicated his
  life to exploring and sharing the value of his Black identity. “Soy obrero del
  proceso de las communidades negras in Ecuador,” he wrote. Others needed to
  understand Afro-Ecuadorians’ spiritual relationship with the land and with
  each other.

<div class="text-h6">A Deeper Dive into History</div>
<p>
  A week later I made an appointment with Tamara Landivar, Curator of
  Ethnography at the museum. Her office is on a lower level, close to a
  labyrinth of secure rooms that house the museum’s vast collection. I explained
  the reason for my visit. Like her colleagues, she knew who Juan Garcia was,
  but she didn’t know about the gift. Then I asked the burning question. Why
  isn’t this precious boat seat in an Ecuadorian museum? First, she said there
  wasn’t space. That seemed strange because Museo Pumapungo is huge. Then again
  space is more than dimensions — it’s appropriateness, security and a
  reflection of priorities.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, her second answer seemed more on point. “We Ecuadorians have an image of
  the United States that is open and free. We see the changes that have been
  made in terms of peoples’ rights. I think he thought that his gift would be
  more respected there and that he also wanted to tell about the African people
  in Ecuador,” she said. “Look,” she continued, pulling out an oversized red,
  yellow and black monograph. “This book is from a 2009 exhibition on
  Afro-Ecuadorian descendants, sponsored by the U.S. Embassy and the Banco
  Central del Ecuador. The exposition circulated in towns throughout Ecuador.
  This smaller brochure is yours to keep.” Since her time was limited, we
  decided on another visit. She offered to connect me with Cuencanos who knew
  more about this subject and show me objects in the storage rooms that reflect
  Afro-Ecuadorian heritage.
</p>
<p>
  Walking home from the museum that day I thought about our conversation. I had
  to unpack this. Respect was the key to unraveling the mystery of an Ecuadorian
  boat seat now prominently displayed in the National Museum of African American
  History and Culture. I settled down to read the brochure and found my first
  clue. In two short paragraphs it places the presence of Africans in the
  Americas in an historical and economic context. I paraphrase from the Spanish:
</p>
<p>
  <em>The treatment of the negros was aligned with the project of modernization
    of Europe, leading to the impoverishment of Africa and conversion of its
    subjects into slaves, stereotyped as inferior beings and objects of
    commerce. The “trata negera” created a commercial triangle. The slaves in
    the Americas produced goods for their owners destined for Europe where
    capitalism was developing, and then with excess profits, the owners bought
    more African slaves.</em>
</p>

<p>
  If the dominant society of any country (in this case ones built largely by
  English and Spanish settler-colonialists) promotes a narrative of anti-Black
  racial superiority for 500 years, you can pretty much expect that disrespect
  for the subjected class will ensue. As British writer and historian David
  Olusoga has pointed out, slavery left not only a legacy of inequality but also
  the idea of a hierarchy of race that has infected language, culture, and to
  some extent, the subconscious.
</p>

<p>
  Juan Garcia Salazar must have felt that disrespect in Ecuador. A 2019
  <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/meet-juan-garcia-salazar-man-who-championed-black-identity-ecuador-180972351/"
    target="_blank">Smithsonian Magazine article</a>
  paid homage to Garcia (who died in 2017) as a champion of Black identity in
  Ecuador and traces the evolution of his work. (English and Spanish link here)
  As a young student, Garcia observed that Ecuadorian history covered only
  Indigenous empires, the Spanish conquest, colonialization and the Republic.
  Where are we, the Black Ecuadorians? he asked. We do not exist.
</p>

<div class="text-h6">Gifts from Africa</div>
<p>
  Yet Garcia knew that African slaves throughout the Americas had not come to
  the “New World” empty handed. Arts, Industry and agriculture were well
  developed on the African continent long before the first Spanish-commissioned
  ships arrived in 1553. Consider only Nigeria’s Benin Bronzes, some of which
  date back to the thirteenth century. Museo Pumapungo’s collection that I saw
  in the storerooms includes instruments for fishing, cultivation, weaving and
  music that reflect African techniques using Ecuadorian materials. For example,
  the marimba was brought to Latin America by African slaves. The museum’s
  Afro-Ecuadorian marimba is made from planks of sugar cane.
</p>
<p>
  Garcia also knew that his people had contributed to the wealth of the nation,
  be it Spain or Ecuador. The work of Black and Indigenous miners alone
  generated profit that helped spur industrialization in Spain, just as
  slave-picked cotton in U.S. fed textile mills in Liverpool and Manchester, not
  to mentions unpaid services in transport, agriculture and domestic work.
  Garcia could not be fooled about his own worth. Once he secured financial
  support in the U.S., he used his research and storytelling skills to leave a
  legacy of self-affirmation for Ecuador’s young Black population — an archival
  treasure-trove of his peoples’ wisdom and cultural significance (over 3,000
  hours of recordings and 10,000 photographs).
</p>
<p>
  Disrespect for Black people as a race is unfounded. First, it is
  scientifically inaccurate since there is only one race — the human race — and
  second, it fails to acknowledge the historical achievements of Black and
  darker-skinned people in the face of long-standing, systemic adversity. If
  Juan Garcia visited Esmeraldas today, he would see just one of many examples
  of how disrespect has consequences. I think he would be disappointed and
  enraged, but perhaps not surprised.
</p>
<p>
  On a recent visit to Esmeraldas by Foundation Hogar de Esperanza, the team
  reported parts of the city are gripped by extreme poverty, racism and lack of
  opportunity that feed into crime and despair. They visited barrios controlled
  by gangs and rural communities where people live as squatters, without basic
  services, education, or heath care. One wonders what assistance these
  predominately Black communities received after the 2016 earthquake. That would
  have been a critical point, as security and public safety experts argue that
  investment in poor and vulnerable communities should be integral to
  comprehensive crime prevention. The 2009 exhibition book mentioned above
  citied a 2004 study that indicated that 62 percent of Ecuadorians surveyed
  said there was racism in Ecuador. Garcia’s visit would affirm what he already
  knew, that disrespect for his people would continue and he needed to protect
  his gift.
</p>
<p>
  Still, I am not satisfied with this ending. My research will continue. I want
  to know more about how Juan Garcia came to this decision and how the physical
  transfer of the gift was made. I want to dig deeper into the issue of respect
  because it seems to me that right now we’ve got the narrative all wrong.

    This was very interesting. I was previously married to an Ecuadorian woman,
    and I have visited and stayed in Ecuador extensively. However, I never knew
    about this part of Ecuador's history.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have also married into a Black family, and I am learning what I can about
    the history of the race. So this article really helped me in that regard.
    Plus, I love visiting museums of any type to learn about many areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have sent this article to my wife, and I'm sure we will be discussing it
    this evening. Now I am thinking a trip to DC is in order as well, as
    visiting the NMAAHC will be that much more enjoyable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you for the article!

    Very informative and timely, your discussion here on the Black race in
    Ecuador, Carol. Esmeraldas is their home and subject to incursions by the
