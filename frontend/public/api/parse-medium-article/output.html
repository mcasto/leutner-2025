<p>
  In October 2023, the Honorable Mia Mottley, Prime Minister of Barbados, gave a
  rousing and fearless speech to the United Nations General Assembly. The topic:
  <strong class="mx gu">sustainable development and poverty</strong>. She told
  the sparsely-populated plenary hall that her constituents, and particularly
  the young, feel that the door to such development and stable livelihoods has
  been closed. Why?
</p>
<p>
  Her analysis can be summarized in three categories: failure to close the
  development deficit; growing concentration of corporate wealth; and erosion of
  the multilateral system. First, I will share the Prime Minister’s thinking,
  mixed with some of my own, in all three areas. Next, I will widen the lens on
  this global financial and political impasse and lay it clearly at the feet of
  racism and consequences of the settler-colonialism mentality. Finally, I will
  explore how to think about this predicament and reverse course.
</p>
<p>
  Barbados has had less than sixty years of independence. Yet, like many nations
  in the Global South (a term used to refer to developing, and least developed,
  countries), she is expected to finance development on terms akin to countries
  with over 200 years of independence and economic growth, but with greater
  levels of risk. High interest rates, burdensome transaction costs and short
  repayment terms create stop-gap programs, not sustainable development. Ms.
  Mottley questions why most developed countries and their multilateral and
  bilateral institutions can’t make 100-year loans, such as those offered to
  Europe for rebuilding after World War II. Great Britian did not pay off its
  war debt until 2006.
</p>
<p>
  The development deficit is not a recent phenomenon, however. Based upon my
  research, its roots go back centuries to the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the
  Age of Exploration, and territorial conquests in Asia, Africa, the Americas
  and Australia — historical facts driven by an invented theory of race
  superiority and the emerging capitalist ideology of self-interest. Racism
  became a handmaiden to the West’s new economic narrative of exploitation and
  greed. Capitalism and racism are inextricably linked.
</p>
<p>
  White settler-colonialists transferred wealth from free labor and conquered
  lands inhabited by darker-skinned and ethnically-diverse populations, to fuel
  European economic development following the mediaeval era and jump-start the
  Industrial Revolution.
</p>
<p>
  Ms. Mottley notes that while reparatory justice is discussed in elite circles,
  including by Britian’s newly-crowned King Charles, it is slow to materialize.
  She argues that without the injection of fiscal and policy spears, her country
  cannot close the development deficit.
</p>
<p>
  According to the Prime Minister, one reason global finance does not work for
  Barbados and most other countries in the Global South is that the dominate
  economic system is neither built in their image nor reflective of their
  interests. Her reason seems justifiable. In the early 90s, around the time of
  the Rio Earth Summit, another more powerful movement was getting underway —
  the unleashing of global capital.
</p>
<p>
  The policies of Reagan, Thatcher, and Clinton lifted investment restrictions;
  the new World Trade Organization offered a level playing field for capital to
  flow. The result was not only globalization but also vast accumulations of
  wealth based on technology: first from oil and gas, then advanced
  manufacturing, followed by the digital era, and now quantum. Such wealth
  writes its own rules. Ms. Mottley stated that even diets are controlled to
  benefit a few international conglomerates.
</p>
<p>
  A revealing example of this reality is the recent Investor-State Dispute
  Settlement (ISDS) tracker report. ISDS courts, provided for in investment
  agreements, allow corporations to sue governments for decisions that adversely
  affect their profits, such as environmental and labor-related laws. To date,
  $114 billion has been paid from public purses, about as much as what rich
  nations provided in climate aid in 2022.
</p>
<p>
  The Prime Minister was pointed in her praise of U.N. Secretary General Antonio
  Gutierrez for his efforts to preserve the multilateral structure. Threats to
  the organization are perhaps greater now than at any time since the Cold War,
  when its efforts to implement a laudable charter were fresh and new. There was
  the promise of protection and sovereignty to small, struggling states, the
  advancement of equity and human dignity, and the elimination of global
  conflict.
</p>
<p>
  But with the existential reality of gross inequality and climate change
  nation-states are pulling back. To maintain power, leaders cater to fear.
  Change has reached its limits. Hungary’s Orban declares the country does not
  want to be diverse and right-wing politics gains adherents. More than 180
  million darker-skinned refugees now on the move from geographies where stable
  livelihoods are no long viable are deemed personas non-gratis. Laws and walls
  block their entry. Internal policies wreak havoc on multilateralism.
</p>
<p>
  The United Nations is unable to arbitrate the crisis. Stark, expert warnings
  of climate doom do not break through the denial. A Middle-Eastern oil
  executive will chair the 2024 climate conference in Azerbaijan. Yet it is the
  one international forum where the parties can talk.
</p>
<p>
  The world is still reeling from the psychological impact of racism and
  ethnocentrism birthed by settler-colonialism, whether within and across
  borders.
</p>
<p>
  This is the message Prime Minister Mottley conveyed without stating the exact
  words. Both cause and consequences ring clear. Collapse of a world order that
  has existed since 1945 is not because of climate change, nuclear war or
  artificial intelligence. It’s because the strait-jacket thinking of
  settler-colonialism doesn’t work anymore. Why?
</p>
<p>

  <strong class="mx gu"
    >The historical narrative as it has been taught in the West is losing
    credibility.</strong
  >
  The sophisticated architectural complex of Turkey’s Gobekli Tepe has been
  dated to twelve thousand years ago. It is unlikely that Sumner, normally
  depicted with White populations and credited as the birthplace of civilization
  seven thousand years ago, developed in isolation.
</p>
<p>
  Humans migrated north and east out of Africa and brought with them millennium
  of survival skills. A mummified child dated to when the Sahara was still
  fertile, along with dogs worshipped as gods, predate Egyptian culture. Egypt’s
  gold came from Kush (present-day Sudan), whose Black pharaohs conquered and
  ruled Egypt for three hundred years.
</p>
<p>
  Archeologist admit that lack of evidence of civilization’s early roots in
  Black communities is due to racism. That which is deemed inferior need not be
  studied — but it may be stolen.
</p>
<p>

  <strong class="mx gu"
    >The West’s historical narrative fails to convey the value Black,
    Indigenous, darker-skinned and ethnically-diverse peoples added to the
    modern world.</strong
  >
  <em class="nt">The Guardian’s</em> 2023 Cotton Capital series documented how
  slave-picked cotton from Mississippi feed textile mills and their capitalist
  owners to build Liverpool and Manchester. The same monetary analysis can be
  applied to the transfer of wealth by settler-colonialists from Spain and
  Portugal in the New World, Germany and Holland in southern Africa, France in
  central and north Africa and Indo-China, Italy in the Horn of Africa, and
  Britian in India and Burma, and the list goes on. Making the global connection
  between labor and finance, reveals how dark people’s contribution was not less
  valuable than those of lighter-skinned people.
</p>
<p>
  While some in power legislate to hide this truth, the historical record of
  racism emerges even more forcefully. Consider the work of the Nikole
  Hannah-Jones and
  <em class="nt">The 1619 Project</em>, whose reliance on original sources cast
  new light on slavery’s role in America’s origin story. Photographs of
  repatriated art once housed in many developed countries’ museums reveal
  masterful works from Africa and Asia dating to before the Renaissance.
  Finally, reflect on Indigenous populations in both North and South America,
  whose stolen land was the basis for economic development in the U.S. and
  Europe. Leaders, who would be loath to admit to racism, now turn to them for
  answers on how to conserve nature and help save the planet.
</p>

  <strong class="mx gu"
    >Political and legal systems that operate to maintain the status quo are
    transparently racist.</strong
  >
  In 2022 Chilean voters went to the polls to approve a new constitution. The
  body charged with drafting the document was gender and ethnically
  representative and proposed multiplural representation, specifically for the
  Mauche (Chile’s only remaining Indigenous population since the others were
  wiped out by the settler-colonialists). When the vote failed, conservatives
  said it was due to unworkable rights in law that would scare off investors.
</p>
<p>
  In 2023 Australia attempted to approve a new constitutional provision that
  would provide for greater representation of Aboriginal peoples by adding an
  “Indigenous Voice to Parliament” advisory body. The vote failed. We can say
  that these efforts failed because those with power intended to hold on to it.
  Dig deeper and the power struggle is grounded in race: the foundation of
  economic and political hegemony in both countries.
</p>
<p>
  Even a recent U.S. state supreme court decision shows how weak and transparent
  the power structure’s reasoning has become. Oklahoma justices denied relief to
  the last remaining survivors of the notorious 1921 Black Wall Street/Tulsa
  race massacre because the plaintiff’s legal theory did not fit into the
  state’s definition of nuisance. Without going into the details of law and
  fact, it seems impossible (even laughable) to try to balance the court’s
  decision against the viciousness of the massacre where over 300 Black people
  died at the hands of the descendants of White settler-colonialists. One is
  forced to consider whether race was a factor in decision-making.

    >The violence of settler-colonialism is happening in real time before our
    eyes — in Palestine.</strong
  >
</p>
<p>
  In a recent
  <em class="nt">New Yorker</em> magazine interview, Lonnie G. Bunch III,
  Secretary of the Smithsonian who is Black, discussed his efforts to expand the
  museum’s exhibitions to include historically underrepresented peoples and
  cultures. He relayed how difficult is it to craft exhibitions that lay bare
  the horrific violence of the Atlantic slave trade, and settler-colonialism
  generally. Yet it is necessary, he concludes, to clarify the context in which
  events occurred, and offer alternative ways of looking at historical facts.
  “Suddenly, I am seeing more complexity. I’m seeing people talk about issues of
  race or gender that they really didn’t talk about before,” he said. Might
  viewing the conflict in the Middle East through the lens of
  settler-colonialism, open such a window for dialogue?
</p>
<p>
  As Israel inhabited more and more of Palestinian territory (taken legally, by
  war, or illegal means) Israel’s role as settler-colonialist became apparent.
  Some called it a system of apartheid that begot violence, requiring more
  control that in turn resulted in more violence, i.e., the attack of 7 October
  2023. Regardless of one’s geopolitical position, watching the Israeli military
  kill almost forty-thousand trapped Palestinians in less than year is hard to
  swallow. And these are brown people (Jesus was a brown Palestinian) being
  killed by White Israelis. What has been difficult to process historically must
  now be confronted on the daily news.
</p>
<p>
  The superiority of and justification for settler-colonialism frames the
  worldview of most White people in developed countries that have benefited from
  its exploitation of labor and resources. I would argue, however, that
  <strong class="mx gu"
    >settler-colonialism as a means for organizing any society is no longer fit
    for purpose, because it is racist.</strong
  >
</p>
<p>
  As Barbados’ Prime Minister Mia Mottley sets forth: it distracts from threats
  of gross wealth inequality and the climate emergency; blocks new ideas and
  information from entering the public sphere; and diminishes the possibility of
  cooperation across the race, gender and class divide, even when
  settler-colonialists themselves face existential risks.
</p>
<p>
  Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari documents that human survival over
  millennium has depended on cooperation. Scientists now postulate the Africa’s
  immense size and genetic diversity enabled advanced cognition and social
  cooperation from which modern humans evolved (Live Science, May, 2024). To
  learn to cooperate once again at this critical juncture, humanity must first
  reach a level of consciousness that homo sapiens belong to one race and move
  beyond the color, gender and ethnic divide. If crises can drive the evolution
  of human collective consciousness, humanity might disprove Harari’s prediction
  that the species will be extinct in 100 years.
