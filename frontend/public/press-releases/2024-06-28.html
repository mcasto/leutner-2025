    RESTON, VIRGINIA, UNITED STATES, June 29, 2024 /<a

    -- Carol E. Leutner's new book <em>Race Consciousness, A Personal and
      Political Journey</em> has won the prestigious 2024 New Generation Indie
    Book Award in the Memoir: History/Legacy category. This prize is given
    annually by the Independent Book Publishing Professionals Group, Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <em>Race Consciousness</em>, Leutner sheds light on issues of race
    and gender prejudice and adversity that face modern America. She
    presents a narrative of discovery about racism and power from the 60s
    to the present and weaves her personal development into the journey.
  </p>
  <p>
    Leutner says, “Much of what people know about the ‘other,’ persons
    different from themselves, comes from third parties. This is
    particularly true regarding race, ethnicity and religion. We learned
    it from our parents, we heard it from someone, we read it somewhere,
    we viewed it on social media. Third-party information is trusted more
    than our own instincts.”

  <p>
    Carol Leutner’s story shows how one-on-one conversation and first-hand
    knowledge and experience can help bridge cultural differences.
  </p>
  <p>
    When she worked with Indigenous and Hispanic communities in the
    American Southwest, she recognized how institutional structures based
    on race influenced economic development. Marriage to a
    politically-active African American revealed how entrenched race-and
    gender-based power structures truly are. Her book reveals the process
    by which she became aware of how these conditions impacted both her
    professional and personal life.
  </p>
  <p>
    This memoir provides context by framing events that Leutner either
    witnessed or inspired from an historical perspective. It is difficult
    to explain the social, political and cultural difficulties that
    Americans now face without knowledge of past struggles.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Race Consciousness</em> is also about raising one’s consciousness,
    opening the mind to greater awareness and understanding, being
    respectful of new information and the interconnectedness of all
    things.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Letting go of old boundaries and assumptions,” Leutner says, “means
    changing the conversation. Humanity is at a juncture where new ways of
    talking and relating are critical.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Leutner’s story can help reimagine a national dialogue where shared
    survival trumps differences—a necessary step to address today’s
    existential threats of artificial intelligence, pandemics, atomic
    warfare, and climate emergency.
