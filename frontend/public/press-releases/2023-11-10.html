      MegaShift Publishing, a boutique publisher based in the Washington D.C.
      area, is pleased to announce the release of <em>Race Consciousness, A Personal and
        Political Journey.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this political memoir, author Carol E. Leutner presents a narrative of
      discovery about racism and power from the 60s to the present that reflects many
      of the issues facing the United States today.

      Leutner says, “Much of what people know about the “other,” persons
      different from ourselves, comes from third parties. This is particularly true regarding race, ethnicity and
      religion. We
      learned it from our parents, we heard it from someone, we read it somewhere, we viewed it on social media.
      Third-party
      information is trusted more than our own instincts.”

      Carol Leutner’s story shows how one-on-one conversation, personal experience, and first-hand knowledge can help
      bridge
      our differences.

      The author recognized how institutional structures based on race influenced economic development, when she worked
      with
      Indigenous and Hispanic communities in the American Southwest. A politically-active marriage to an African
      American
      revealed how entrenched race-and gender-based power structures truly are. Her book reveals the process by which
      she
      became aware of the conditions impacting her life.

      This memoir also provides context by framing events that Leutner either
      witnessed or inspired from an historical perspective. It is difficult to explain the
      social, political and cultural difficulties that Americans now face without
      knowledge of past struggles, indeed many struggles.
    </p>

      <em>Race Consciousness</em> covers decades of personal and political
      struggles. It provides analysis and insight as to why both public and
      private decisions were made--context for how events unfolded as they
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book is also about raising one’s consciousness, opening the mind to
      greater awareness and understanding, and being respectful of new information
      and the interconnectedness of all things. Letting go of old boundaries and
      assumptions means changing the conversation. Humanity is at a juncture where
      new ways of talking and relating are critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carol’s story can help reimagine a national dialogue where shared survival
      trumps differences---a necessary step to address the existential threats of
      artificial intelligence, pandemics, atomic warfare, and the climate emergency.
